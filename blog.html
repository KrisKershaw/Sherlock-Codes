        <h3>Putting a name to the face - November 2020</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Celebrations to be had, our game is now into it's beta phase! At this point the game requires significant testing and tweeking, but the horizon isn't far away for the release of our game! Oh, the name you ask? Well we've got one for you. Drum roll please... Code-Blooded Killer! We'll also drop a little bit more and give you a premise: Awoken in the early hours of the morning by a phone call, you - the detective - are told to immediately report down to the scene of a crime... a brutal murder. With puzzles, evidence and conundrums to be explored, will you be able to figure out who committed the murder? Love, the Sherlock Codes team.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Welcome! We're Sherlock Codes, and this is the start of our adventure! We're a team of 4 programmers with a shared goal of making an immersive new game murder mystery game (we plan to further diversify in the future, but one step at a time!). The project is currently unnamed, but we're extremely excited to be able to do this and share it with the world! Love, the Sherlock Codes team.</p>
