                <p>Who is Sherlock Codes?:</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Sherlock Codes is currently a small indie games developer that pride themselves on creating and inventing fun projects that we ourselves would love to play!</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>We first started out in July 2020 with the premise of an idea for a murder mystery game. Things have been hectic ever since, but we're extremely proud to be able to say we've finished our first ever game: Code-Blooded Killer!</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Our team of 4 will be looking to expand in the future - if you feel like you'd want to join our family here at Sherlock Codes, please don't hesitate to e-mail us on our Contact page! We're not currently hiring but will definitely be looking into expanding our team in the near future.</p>
